Josh Whalen Photography Products I offer all of my images as photographic prints and greeting cards on a variety of paper types available in several sizes. I also make ordering custom framed prints easy using an online framing tool.  Please contact me if you are interested in ordering framed artwork. All custom frames are delivered to your door ready to hang. All of my images are also available to license for personal and commercial use as stock photography with immediate downloads. For commercial applications, I offer the high quality options listed below that are well suited for making your high volume orders more efficient than the traditional custom framing process. If you are a trade professional interested in ordering the products below for your commercial projects, please contact me to set up an account.   Gallery Wrapped Canvas The image of your choice will be printed on museum-quality canvas and hand stretched over a custom built 1.25" thick wooden frame. The canvas is then laminated with a UV protective layer. This coating ensures the longevity of the print by protecting the ink from scratches and fading. This is a beautiful and contemporary way to display your artwork.    Facemount Acrylic The image of your choice will be printed on photographic paper and mounted to the back of high quality cast acrylic.  The acrylic comes with standoffs in all four corners allowing the artwork to float out from the wall.  This gives your artwork a sleek, modern look and also increases the image sharpness, contrast and color saturation of the print.      Brushed Aluminum The image of your choice will be printed on brushed aluminum. The texture of the brushed metal shows through the surface giving the image a translucent luminescence.  These vibrant prints are not only elegant but also extremely durable.  The ultra-hard surface is scratch-resistant and can be cleaned easily with any commercial glass cleaner.  For easy installation, a silver metal frame is rear mounted inset from the edges of the print allowing the artwork to float off the wall.  Alternately, standoff options are available for an additional charge.     Eco-Friendly Bamboo The image of your choice will be printed on bamboo. The beautiful texture of the bamboo shows through the surface adding a nice organic element to the image.  The image is printed directly onto the sustainable bamboo plywood using solvent-free UV inks creating bold, rich images that are perfect for any green environment.  For easy installation, an inset 3/4 inch wooden frame is rear mounted inset from the edges of the print allowing the artwork to float off the wall.
