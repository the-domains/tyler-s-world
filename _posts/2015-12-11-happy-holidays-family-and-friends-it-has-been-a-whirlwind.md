Happy holidays family and friends!  It has been a whirlwind of a year. Tyler celebrated her first birthday on December 8th! We definitely padded ourselves on the back for keeping her alive for an entire year. It has been an amazing, yet humbling experience. She is full of fun, laughter and surprises... each day brings a new adventure. Currently, we are working on multiple teeth, walking, talking and growing hair! Will it be red and curly? Hopefully we'll find out in the New Year! Her favorite words to date are; hat, that, duck, book, mama, papa, dada, and packpack.  Josh is as busy as ever... Captain Dad and Photographer. Tyler adores him and he adores Tyler. They spend their weekdays strollerblading, hiking local trails, swinging at the playground and playing at the beach. This year has taken us to many photographer's dream locations, including Yosemite, Telluride, Paris and Hamburg. Josh's business is doing well and he continues to shoot whenever he can. Our recent introduction to a nanny will allow for more time on that front... Kayd is still working for InterAmerican Coffee, running their office here in San Diego. The team is growing and business is good! She continues to travel, but slowed down her schedule a bit over the past year. She is back biking to work as often as possible and doing as much gardening as time will allow! Its been a busy year but she continues to maintain a good work - life balance :) In November, Josh's mom Karen slipped peacefully into her angel wings surrounded by love and family. We were able to spend her last moments sharing memories, laughing and crying together. We reflected on the beauty of a life well-lived, and the way she in fact embodied that same attitude during all the different chapters of her journey. Physically she will be missed, but we can definitely still feel her strong presence. Thank you all for sending us so much love during this challenging time. Lots of love and best wishes in 2016! Kayd, Josh and Tyler
